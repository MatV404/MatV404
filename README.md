Hello, my name is Matthew and I'm a student of programming and application development at the Faculty of Informatics, Masarykova University in Brno.
The Projects you will find at my github as of the time of this being written (22.10.2021) are mostly projects I've worked on in the past as part of 
Microsoft Student Training Center Slovakia, when I was just beginning to get into serious programming, or my latest projects that I get to work on
whenever I don't need to focus much on studying.
